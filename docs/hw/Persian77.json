And when urged, the first letter thereof was uttered, whereupon the dwellers of the celestial chambers rushed forth out of their habitation of glory. And whilst the second letter was pronounced they fell down, one and all, upon the dust. At that moment a voice was heard from the inmost shrine: “Thus far and no farther.” Verily We bear witness to that which they have done and now are doing.","teaser":"In the night-season the beauty...","prev":{"id":"Persian76","title":"Persian 76","section":"Persian","number":"76","exhort":"O SON OF MY HANDMAID!","text":"Guidance hath ever been given by words, and now it is given by deeds.
