Although quite short, measuring only 153 passages, it is nonetheless considered Bahá’u’lláh’s primary ethical work. Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, described it as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>...that marvelous collection of gem-like utterances, the “Hidden Words” with which Bahá’u’lláh was inspired, as He paced, wrapped in His meditations, the banks of the Tigris. Revealed in the year 1274 A.H., partly in Persian, partly in Arabic, it was originally designated the “Hidden Book of Fátimih,” and was identified by its Author with the Book of that same name, believed by Shí’ah Islám to be in the possession of the promised Qá’im, and to consist of words of consolation addressed by the angel Gabriel, at God’s command, to Fátimih, and dictated to the Imám ‘Alí, for the sole purpose of comforting her in her hour of bitter anguish after the death of her illustrious Father. The significance of this dynamic spiritual leaven cast into the life of the world for the reorientation of the minds of men, the edification of their souls and the rectification of their conduct can best be judged by the description of its character given in the opening passage by its Author: “<em>This is that which hath descended from the Realm of Glory, uttered by the tongue of power and might, and revealed unto the Prophets of old. We have taken the inner essence thereof and clothed it in the garment of brevity, as a token of grace unto the righteous, that they may stand faithful unto the Covenant of God, may fulfill in their lives His trust, and in the realm of spirit obtain the gem of Divine virtue.</em>”<br> (Shoghi Effendi, <a href=https://www.bahai.org/r/030230792 target=_blank><em>God Passes By</em>, 140</a>)</p> </blockquote> <p>The Hidden Words are available on the <a href=https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/bahaullah/hidden-words/ target=_blank>official website of the Bahá’í Faith</a>.</p> <h2>About this presentation</h2> <p>This presentation of the Hidden Words was created by David Hunt in 2019 using Svelte and Sapper.
